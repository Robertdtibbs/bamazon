The node.js store where you can fake buy obscure everyday items.

How bamazon works... well it needs your help!  Open your terminal until you get to path /Documents/Bootcamp/bamazon. 
You will then need to download the necessary npm files but lets act like you've done this before. 
In the Terminal you will enter node bamazonCustomer.js.

The store has also been calculating how much you spend each time you make a purchase.
