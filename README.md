Bamazon!!!!!!!!!
The node.js store where you can fake buy obscure everyday items.

How bamazon works... well it needs your help!  Open your terminal until you get to path /Documents/Bootcamp/bamazon. 
You will then need to download the necessary npm files but lets act like you've done this before. 
In the Terminal you will enter node bamazonCustomer.js.

Once you press enter on "View Items for sale: this will then appear before you:

You will then enter the numeric item # you would like to purchase and enter the quantity you need.
This will what you will see:

Let's say you forgot something and need to go back in the store.
You will then see this:

As you can tell the store updates the stock based on what you have purchased.  
The store has also been calculating how much you spend each time you make a purchase.

Have fun!
